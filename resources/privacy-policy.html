<h4>Information we collect</h4>

<p>When you visit AllPlayers.com, you provide us with personal information that you knowingly choose to disclose through registration and website use, and is collected by us as you interact with our website and enter information and data.</p>

Cookies enable you to be recognized when you return to our website to review information, add / update / delete information, or place an order.

<h4>Using information we collect</h4>

<p>Profile and personal information is entered by you and is used by AllPlayers.com primarily to be presented back to you and edited by you when you access the service. You maintain control of your personal information.  When you register for a group, the information collected during registration is presented to the appropriate organization within our member management solution, which you control through your privacy settings. In some cases where your privacy settings permit it (e.g., posting a comment to your profile page feature), other AllPlayers.com users may be able to add information to your profile, but you will always maintain control of your profile through your privacy settings and site features (e.g., deleting a posted comment feature). At AllPlayers.com, we strive to provide you with the best possible online experience and manage your transactions exactly as you've requested. In order to do this, we collect information that allows us to:</p>

<ul class="content">
	<li>Process and track your transaction</li>
	<li>Provide the services that you request and process payments in conjunction with those requests</li>
	<li>Contact you about the status of a transaction</li>
	<li>Improve our merchandise selection and customer service level</li>
</ul>

<a name="share"></a>

The primary goal is to place parents in control over what information is collected from their child online.</p>
<p>AllPlayers.com is very serious about total compliance with COPPA and has put the following provisions in place to ensure that every child’s privacy is protected.  COPPA defines a child as their age being 12 and under.</p>
