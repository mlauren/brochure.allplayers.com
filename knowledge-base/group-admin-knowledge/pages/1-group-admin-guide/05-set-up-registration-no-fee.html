  <h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
  <p>Once you have created your group at AllPlayers.com, you'll want members to join your group!</p>
  <p>To allow people to join your group, you will need to enable registration. With AllPlayers.com, you can have free registration, or you can require that members pay a fee to join the group.</p>
  <p>In this section, we will focus on enabling registration for a group that does not require fees to join.</p>
  <p>While there are many ways to set up registration for leagues and teams, in this example, we will enable registration to allow players, parents and fans to join a team.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="six columns">
      <p>We will start configuring registration for your group by adjusting some of the main settings.  </p>
    </div>

        <img src="images/knowledge/group_admin-reg-settings-large.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h4>Registration date and time</h4>
  <p>Adjusting this settings allows registration to automatically be enabled and disabled for this group.</p>
  <p>To enable automatic registration, click <strong>edit</strong>, then check the box next to <strong>Automatically Enable/Disable Registration</strong>. You can then select the start and end dates and times for registration.</p>

  <h4>Registration Title</h4>
  <p>The registration title is the title that registrants will see when registering for your group.</p>

  <h4>Registration Description</h4>
  <p>The registration description is the message that is displayed to logged out users when visiting your registration page.</p>

  <h4>Registration Fees</h4>
  <p>This will let you know if you have the ability to receive registration fees from registrants.</p>
  <p>If you see <strong>Enabled</strong>, you already have the ability to receive registration fees. If you see <strong>Requested</strong>, you have requested this ability but are not yet able to receive registration fees. If you see <strong>Disabled</strong>, you can request the ability to receive registration fees by clicking <strong>Edit</strong>, and then check the box next to <strong>Request fee capability</strong>.</p>

  <h4>Registration Button Text</h4>
  <p>Select the <strong>Registration Button Text</strong> that you want to display on your registration button. When registration is enabled for your group, visitors will click that button to join your group.</p>
  <p>We recommend <strong>Register</strong> for groups that require a registration fee, and <strong>Join</strong> for groups that are free to join.</p>

  <h4>Subgroup registration</h4>
  <p>Enable if you are enabling registration for a group, and you want users to select a subgroup to join.</p>
  <p><i>For example, if you are setting up registration for a league with age division subgroups, enabling this feature will allow users to select their age division when they sign up for the league</i>.</p>

  <h4>Allow guardian to register child</h4>
  <p>Allows a parent/guardian to register their child for the group on the child's behalf.</p>

  <h4>Guardian Registration Forms</h4>
  <p>Adds a registration form that a guardian must fill out if they are registering a child for the group.</p>

  <h4>General release information</h4>
  <p>If your group requires a member to agree to any terms or conditions when they join your group, enter that text in the <strong>General Release</strong> field.

  <h4>Show registration breadcrumb</h4>
  <p>This allows you to enable or disable the indicator showing the user what step they are in during registration.</p>
  <p><i>In most instances, there is no reason to disable this.</i></p>

  <h4>Age Requirements</h4>
  <p>If a role is age-restricted, choose the minimum and maximum ages. <i>TIP: If your league allows players to "play up" to the next age level, ensure that your minimum age is set to allow younger players to join the group</i>.</p>

  <h4>Gender Requirements</h4>
  <p>Restrict your role to allow only males or females in a given role (for example, players in a girls' basketball league) if necessary.</p>

  <h4>Hide role selection</h4>
  <p>If you do not want to show a role on your registration page for your group, check this box. Then provide the Direct Role Registration URL to the person(s) you want to register for this role.</p>

  <h4>Challenge Code</h4>
  <p>If you only want certain people to register for a specific role in your group, enable the challenge code and enter a code of your choice. Provide this code to a user to restrict registration to only those who know the code. The role will only become visible once the challenge code is entered.</p>

  <h4>Allow when registering others</h4>
  <p>For current group members who have the permission to register other users to this group, this role can only be added by them if this option is enabled.</p>

  <h4>Flag role when paid</h4>
  <p>For roles with registration fees attached, assign the specified flag to the user when they have completed payment.</p>

  <h4>Additional role when payment complete</h4>
  <p>For roles with registration fees attached, assign an additional role to the registrant once they have completed payment.</p>

  <h4>Do not assign this role until fees are paid</h4>
  <p>This role will not be assigned to the registrant until the registration fee is paid.</p>
